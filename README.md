# Hospital Management System (Flaskapp)

This scope of this project was to create a Hospital ICU resources dashboard. A database and website dashboard were created for prototype review.

The focus of this project was to set up the initial resources database. Due to the limited time nature of a semester-long project, the majority of time was dedicated to database formulation, so the scope of the website design is minimal.
